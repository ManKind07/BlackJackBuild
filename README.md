# BlackJack Game in Python

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic BlackJack card game built using Python. Designed as a beginner project, it demonstrates the fundamental concepts of Python programming including handling user input, working with dictionaries and lists, and implementing game logic with random elements.

## Key Features

- **Multiplayer Support**: Allows multiple players to participate, each with their own betting amount and hand.
- **Card Dealing**: Simulates dealing cards to players and the dealer with random card values.
- **Game Rules**: Implements basic BlackJack rules such as hitting, standing, and busting.
- **Dynamic Input Handling**: Users can choose values for Aces and decide whether to hit or stand.
- **Game Outcomes**: Determines the winner based on the highest valid score and calculates payouts.

## How to Use

1. **Setup**: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. **Run the Game**: Execute the script using Python. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.
   ```bash
   python blackjack.py
   ```
3. **Start the Game**:
   - Input the number of players when prompted.
   - Enter player names and bets.
   - Follow the prompts to play the game, including making decisions to "Hit" or "Stop."
   - The game will display the results and payouts after all players have completed their turns.

## Example

Here’s a brief overview of how the game works:

1. **Player Setup**: Players enter their names and bets.
2. **Dealing Cards**: Each player is dealt two cards, with options to choose values for Aces.
3. **Player Turn**: Players decide whether to "Hit" (draw another card) or "Stop" (end their turn).
4. **Game Resolution**: The game determines which players have won and calculates payouts based on their final scores.

## Future Improvements

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Transition from console-based interaction to a graphical interface using libraries such as Tkinter or Pygame.
- **Advanced Game Features**: Add more BlackJack features like splitting hands, doubling down, and more complex betting options.
- **Code Refactoring**: Improve code organization and readability by incorporating functions and classes.
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling and user input validation to ensure a smoother gameplay experience.
